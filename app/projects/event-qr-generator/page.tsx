							<h2>üìö Description</h2>
							<hr />
							<p>
								<b>Background: </b>
								The Event QR Code Generator was the main project I worked on during
								my time as an ACM Diamond Staff member (you can read more about my
								ACM experience&nbsp;
								<Link href="/experience/acm-ucsd" className={styles.link}>
										here
								</Link>
								.) I built this tool for Breadbot, one of two Discord bots ACM had at
								the time I completed this project. ACM hosts a lot of events, workshops,
								and socials, and we wanted a way for attendees to easily check into these
								events by scanning a QR code when they first arrive so they can earn
								membership points to purchase ACM merch with. Although ACM had a QR code
								generator already, it was just a simple black and white QR code and wasn't
								very visually appealing. I aimed to completely revamp this tool and create
								something that would pop at the check-in table.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Project Details: </b>
								To generate a QR code for an event, members can run the <em>/checkin</em>
								&nbsp;command on ACM's Discord server. The revamped version generates a
								colorful QR code on a slide and displays the event name and event check-in
								code (the code can be used to manually check in through the ACM
								Membership Portal.) I programmed the bot in TypeScript with discord.js,
								easyqrcodejs-nodejs, and canvas.
							</p>
							<p>
								My biggest takeaway from this project was a deeper understanding of
								asynchronous functions. I knew about this topic beforehand but wasn't
								too familiar with it, so I ended up being stuck for a long time on a bug
								where I wasn't waiting for an async function to finish running. Knowing
								more about async functions helped me identify similar issues on multiple
								other occasions, such as a bug in the&nbsp;

								&nbsp;that caused users to have to click the login button twice to sign in.
