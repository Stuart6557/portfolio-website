							<h2>üìö Description</h2>
							<hr />
							<p>
								<b>Background: </b>
								I collaborated with 3 of my friends to build Green Guide for LA Hacks
								2023. We chose the Green House track, which was all about sustainability,
								and built a web app designed to help people stay informed about what to
								do with different types of waste.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Project Details: </b>
								Users will be able to access a few different resources and features
								upon creating and/or signing into an account. There are flippable
								double-sided cards on the home page that serve as a guide to waste
								sorting and contain links to external resources. There is also a
								recycling tracker to help users document their recycling habits and a
								memory matching game for fun.
							</p>
							<p>
								I acted as an engineering manager for this project, setting up the repo,
								creating issues, and giving a mini React crash course to some of my
								teammates who were new to React. I worked on some of the frontend and also
								learned React context and Firebase for the authentication since none of us
								knew how to do this before the hackathon. (Fun fact: I stayed up until 5am
								to figure this out). My friends managed to build some incredible features
								as I was working on the authentication, and in the end I was proud that
								we were able to get our app working.
							</p>
							<p>
								We didn't have that much time during the hackathon to build everything we
								wanted to, especially since we also wanted to experience the UCLA life
								(side note: UCLA dining halls are absolutely incredible). If we had more
								time, we would've added a backend and a data visualization tool for the
								recycling tracker. I would also try to improve the code quality, since we
								were rushing to get everything done and didn't have time to do so at the
								hackathon. For example, I would add linting, enforce consistent use of CSS
								variables, and remove any hard coded values to have a more responsive web
								design.
